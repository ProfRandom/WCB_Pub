# Ontological Reasoning

The **Monon Condition** describes bodies that arise through **natural self-organization of matter under fundamental forces** — gravity, electromagnetism, chemical cohesion, nuclear binding, and related interactions.

Artificial constructs (spacecraft, megastructures, cities) are **assemblages of monons**, but their unity is *contextual or intentional*, not *intrinsic.*  
They are bound by design, maintenance, or structural assembly — not by a single, dominant natural force that defines their existence as one.

## Classification Rule — The Monon Condition

> **All WCB monon series** (*planemon, intermon, stellamon, etc.*) refer exclusively to **naturally occurring, self-coherent bodies** — not to multi-body systems, artificial constructs, collections, or diffuse regions.

### 🔒 What *Is* a Monon

A **monon** is defined by:

- A single, well-defined **center of cohesion** (typically a center of mass, or equivalent binding focus);  
- Internally unified **self-coherent structure**, maintained by dominant internal forces — **chemical**, **gravitational**, **electromagnetic**, or **nuclear**, depending on scale;  
- A physically continuous **volume or field boundary** (or event horizon, in the case of black holes).  

**Examples:** **nanomons, minimons, planemons, intermons, stellamons, supermons, ultramons, hypermons**

#### WCB Monon Rule (Monon-Series Scope Clarification)

> **All mononic classifications** (*planemon, intermon, stellamon, cryptomon, etc.*) apply only to **individual, contiguous, self-bound objects.**  
>  
> Multi-object systems — whether binary, ternary, or aggregate — are **not themselves monons**, even if composed entirely of monons.

### 🚫 What *Is Not* a Monon

| Category | Example | Reason for Exclusion |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Star Clusters** | Globular clusters, open clusters | Multi-body systems |
| **Nebulae / Clouds** | Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) | Diffuse, non-contiguous matter |
| **Galaxies** | Milky Way, Andromeda | Aggregates of many gravitational centers |
| **Binary Systems** | Sirius A + B, Pluto–Charon | Contain ≥ 2 centers of cohesion |
| **Black-Hole Binaries** | LIGO-detected pairs | Still system-level constructs |
| **Artificial Constructs** | Voyager 1, orbital stations | Assembled by intent, not natural self-organization |

## Summary of Principles

1. **Monon Series is not emergent.**  
   A *system of planemons* is not a larger planemon.  
   A *binary of stellamons* is not a single, larger stellamon.

2. **Modeling convenience ≠ ontological unity.**  
   In orbital mechanics it is **useful** to treat a binary as one object of combined mass.  
   Ontotypically, however, the **barycenter abstraction** is *not* a monon.

3. **Distinct fields of cohesion.**  
   - A monon has one **center of cohesion**, even if dynamic (e.g., a rotating planemon).  
   - A system has **multiple discrete centers**, even if mathematically reducible.  

> For instance, in a double-star stellamonic system it may be convenient to treat the two stellamons as a single mass centered on the barycenter of their orbits.  
> Yet this is only a **mathematical convenience** derived from system properties — not a **physical entity** in itself.
