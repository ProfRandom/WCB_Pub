# Animotic Domains
## Telluric Domain

m := ⟨0.01 ∧ 10.00⟩⨁ 
ρ := ⟨0.50 ∧ 7.00⟩⨁ 
g := ⟨0.15 ∧ 8.00⟩⨁ 
r := ⟨0.15 ∧ 3.00⟩⨁
vₑ := ⟨0.20 ∧ 3.00⟩⨁

> **Tellurics** are parahabitable worlds with solid or semi-solid surfaces — encompassing the full class of rocky, metallic, and icy planemons. 
> This category includes Earthlike worlds, massive rocky exoplanets, marginal sub-Earths, and bodies like Mars, Ganymede, Titan, or large moons of gas giants. 
> It defines the geophysical domain of terrestrial planemons — whether habitable or not — and serves as the primary envelope from which Geotic, Gaean, and Argeic worlds are derived.

**Core Feature** 
- This is a broad categorization — about $1.86$% of Tellurics are Geotics, and only about **0.55%** of all Tellurics are Gaeans — and **3.6%** of Tellurics are Argeics. 
- These worlds possess defined solid surfaces or lithospheres, with no requirement for biological habitability. 
- Many are parahabitable — survivable with life-support systems, domes, or partial terraforming. 
- May include frozen dwarfs, massive dry worlds, or oceanic with no dry land.
**Relations to Other Types** 
- Contains all Geotic, Gaean, and Argeic worlds. 
- Overlaps with Xenotic worlds in the rocky mass range. 
- Worlds like Mars, Titan, Io, and Kepler-20b are all Tellurics, despite wildly different surface conditions.
**Symbolic Use** 
- The term draws from *Tellus*, the Latin Earth-mother, but in this context is **geostructural**, not biological. 
- When contrasted with *Xenotic*, the distinction is about **structure** (rocky vs. exotic or gaseous), not life-hosting potential.

## Terric Realm

m := ⟨0.30 ∧ 3.35⟩⨁
ρ := ⟨0.85 ∧ 1.25⟩⨁
g := ⟨0.60 ∧ 1.65⟩⨁
r := ⟨0.60 ∧ 1.50⟩⨁
vₑ := ⟨0.65 ∧ 1.50⟩⨁

$$
\text{GEOTIC} := \left\{ (m, \rho) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \middle|\
\begin{aligned}
&0.30 ≤ m ≤ 3.35 \\
&0.85 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.25 \\
&0.60 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.65 \\
&0.60 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.50 \\
&0.65 ≤ v_e(m, \rho) ≤ 1.50
\end{aligned}

> *Geotics* are **habitable** planemons — terrestrial-class worlds where humans can survive and thrive with minimal adaptation. These planemons fall within a broader Earth-like envelope, allowing a wider range of environmental and structural conditions than Gaeans, while remaining physically and biologically viable for Earth-based life. Atmospheric processing, infrastructure, or selective location may be required, but **shirtsleeve environments** are still plausible.

**Core Feature**:
- *Density bounds* are kept narrow to ensure terrestrial composition (i.e., rocky–metallic silicate structure), but mass and radius are permitted greater variation, producing a range of surface gravities and escape velocities still compatible with Earth-based life — particularly plants, microbes, and well-supported human habitation.
**Implication**:
- Geotics may include:
 - **Marginal Earth-twins** (on the edges of Gaean parameters)
 - **High-gravity super-Earths** (with greater landmass and thicker atmospheres)
 - **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes** (with lower pressure and gravity, but survivable biospheres)
**Geotic ≠ Gaean**:
- All **Gaean** worlds are a *subset* of Geotics.
- But Geotics may include conditions beyond optimal comfort — requiring adaptation or technology to sustain human colonization.

## Geotic Domain

### Gaean Province

m := ⟨1.00 ∧ 1.85⟩⨁
ρ := ⟨0.85 ∧ 1.25⟩⨁
g := ⟨0.85 ∧ 1.10⟩⨁
r := ⟨0.90 ∧ 1.30⟩⨁

$$
\text{GAEAN} := \left\{ (m, \rho) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \middle|\
\begin{aligned}
&1.00 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.25 \\
&0.85 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.10 \\
&0.90 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.30 \\

\end{aligned}
\right\}
$$
> *Gaeans* are **hospitable** planemons — worlds whose surface environments require no special adaptation for unaided human life. They maintain **Earth-normal gravity** (⟨0.90 ∧ 1.10⟩⨁), and all other physical parameters — mass, radius, density, and escape velocity — fall within tightly Earthlike bounds. These planemons support **shirtsleeve conditions**: humans can breathe the air, walk freely on the surface, and survive long-term without technological intervention.
> *All Gaeans are Geotics, but not all Geotics are Gaeans*.

### Gaean Worlds and the Gravity One Corridor
Gaean worlds are **hospitable** by definition — capable of supporting unmodified human life on the surface. But more than that, their defining feature is a surface gravity **within ±10% of Earth’s**, or:
* 0.90 ≤ g ≤ 1.10 (in Earth gravities)

#### The Gravity One Corridor
This range centers on what we call the **Gravity One Corridor** — the precise locus of all planemon configurations (*mass–density pairs*) that yield **surface gravity = 1.000⨁**.

This narrow but critical pathway through parameter space defines the zone of optimal human comfort, physiology, architecture, and biomechanical function.

> When **g = 1.000⨁**, everything else — escape velocity, radius, and structural density — falls into predictable and manageable ranges.

As shown in the diagram:
- Planetary **mass (m)** and **density (ρ)** balance precisely to maintain **g = 1**.
- The resulting values for:
 - **Radius (r)** range from ~0.85⨁ to 1.25⨁
 - **Escape velocity (vₑ)** from ~0.70⨁ to 1.30⨁
- This corridor provides an ideal baseline from which all other habitable world classes are derived.

#### Why This Matters
Approximately 17.7% of all Geotics fall **within or near** the Gravity One Corridor. Deviating too far from it — even if mass and radius are "in range" — results in a world that is:
- Less biomechanically comfortable
- More energetically expensive to escape
- More geostructurally unstable
- More challenging to terraform or sustain

In short:
> **The closer a world hugs the Gravity One Corridor, the easier it is to call home.**

## Argeic Realm

m := ⟨1.00 ∧ 3.00⟩⨁
ρ := ⟨0.85 ∧ 1.25⟩⨁
g := ⟨0.85 ∧ 1.70⟩⨁
r := ⟨0.90 ∧ 1.50⟩⨁
vₑ := ⟨0.95 ∧ 1.50⟩⨁

$$
\text{Argeic} := \left\{ (m, \rho) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \middle|\
\begin{aligned}
&1.00 ≤ m ≤ 3.00 \\
&0.85 ≤ \rho ≤ 1.25 \\
&0.85 ≤ g(m, \rho) ≤ 1.70 \\
&0.90 ≤ r(m, \rho) ≤ 1.50 \\
&0.95 ≤ v_e(m, \rho) ≤ 1.50
\end{aligned}
\right\}
$$
> *Argeics* are **parahabitable** planemons — terrestrial super-Earths with conditions **favorable to rich biospheres** but likely **inhospitable to unmodified humans**. They may possess higher surface gravity, thicker atmospheres, and more energetic climates, often demanding mechanical, biological, or infrastructural adaptations for long-term Earthling presence. Nonetheless, they are considered highly conducive to complex, robust life — just not necessarily Earthlike.

**Overlap with Gaeans**:
- A **small subset** of Argeics — **≈13.9%** — fall within the Gaean gravity range (0.9 ≤ g ≤ 1.1⨁). 
- These rare worlds are **massive and dense** enough to support Earth-normal surface conditions **while offering enhanced biospheric potential** — possibly the best of both worlds.
**Core Feature**:
- The **“superhabitable” zone**: larger size means broader climatic bands, more plate tectonics, greater magnetic shielding, and longer tectonic–volcanic cycling — all of which may favor biospheric richness and diversity. 
- **Human settlement** is plausible but typically **requires support**: enhanced structural design, medical mitigation of gravity effects, and climate regulation systems.
**Distinction from Geotics**:
- All Argeics meet **Geotic** compositional constraints, but their **mass and gravity trends upward**. 
- **Not all Geotics** are Argeic: Argeics are a **subset of high-mass, dense, habitable** planemons. 
- Conversely, **not all Argeics are Gaean** — only a small slice of them match that precise Earthlike window.

# Argeic (Superhabitable) planemons

**Definition** 
The concept of *superhabitable planemons* was proposed by René Heller and John Armstrong (2014) to describe worlds with physical, orbital, and stellar characteristics that make them **more conducive to rich, diverse biospheres** than Earth — though not necessarily more suitable for humanoid or Earthlike life.

**Stellar Criteria** 
- Host star mass range: ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⟩⊙ (spectral classes M0∧G9)
- Host star lifespan: ⟨1.656 ∧ 12.934⟩⊙ years 
- Stellar age: Older than the Sun’s 4.5 Ga but younger than 7 Ga 

**Planemon Characteristics** 
- **Mass**: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⟩⨁ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁) 
- **Radius**: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⟩⨁ (maintains Earthlike density and gravity) 
- **Geology**: Larger tectonic–volcanic cycling, longer plate tectonic activity, strong carbon–silicate cycle, thicker atmosphere retention. 
- **Magnetic Field**: Stronger due to larger liquid core and higher internal heat. 
- **Surface Geography**: Flatter topography, shallower oceans, widely distributed ocean coverage (~71% surface area) without large continuous land masses. 
- **Temperature**: Mean ≈ 25 °C (77 °F). 
- **Atmosphere**: Thicker than Earth’s; O₂ concentration > 20.95%. 
- **Orbit**: Closer to the center of the host system’s habitable zone than Earth is in the Solar System. 
 - Solar System example: center of optimistic HZ ≈ 1.26 AU; center of conservative HZ ≈ 1.16 AU.

**Scientific Rationale** 
From Heller & Armstrong (2014): 
> “Terrestrial planemons that are slightly more massive than Earth, up to 2 or 3 M⊕, are preferably superhabitable due to the longer tectonic activity, a carbon–silicate cycle active on a longer timescale, enhanced magnetic shielding, larger surface area, smoother surface, thicker atmosphere, and the positive effects of non-intelligent life on habitability.”

Lena Noack & Doris Breuer (2011) add: 
> “…the propensity of plate tectonics seems to have a peak between 1 and 5 Earth masses… a geological perspective suggests the optimal mass of a planemon is about 2 M⊕.”

**Relation to WCB Classifications** 
In *Worlds by the Numbers*, **Argeic planemons** encompass the superhabitable concept, with parameter refinements for internal consistency within WCB’s classification system.

> *Xenotics* are planemons whose environmental conditions may support **non-Earthlike life**, including **non-carbonic**, **non-water-based**, or otherwise exotic biochemistries. The term is not tied to physical parameters, but to the **biological strangeness** of the world's potential life-hosting capacity.

**Core Feature**:
- Xenotic classification **is not about what the world *is*** — it’s about **what kind of life it might support**.
- A Xenotic world might be a rocky, icy, or gaseous body — but its **biotic potential lies outside** the realm of Earth-normal life.
- This is an *extremely* broad classification: only 0.35% of planemons sharing Xenotic mass and density ranges qualify as *Tellurics*. Gaeans share mass and density range with only 0.001% of Xenotics.
**Key Principle**:
> A world may fall entirely within Gaean or Geotic **parameters** and still be **Xenotic in character** — if its biosphere is chemically or structurally **alien to terrestrial assumptions**.

**Included Provinces**:
- **Ammonia-based** or **methanogenic** biospheres (e.g., Titan-like)
- **Silicon-based** or **plasma phase** consciousness (hypothetical)
- **High-pressure deep-atmosphere lifeforms** on gas giants
- **Ultra-dense crust-worlds** with lattice-bonded metabolic substrates
- **Life emerging in conditions unreplicable on Earth**
**Exclusions**:
- Gaean or Geotic worlds are **not Xenotic** simply by shape or size.
- Xenotic worlds **may physically overlap** with all other categories — but their **life potential diverges completely**.
**Symbolic Use**:
- From Greek *xenos* (ξένος): “stranger,” “foreigner,” “outsider.” 
- Xenotic worlds are those where **life is not just different — it is alien**.
**Parameter Notes**:
- **Mass (⨁):** from sublunar pebbles to brown dwarf threshold. 
- **Density (⨁):** from hydrogen-ice slushes to ultra dense crystal-metallic cores. 
- **Gravity (⨁):** ~0.02⨁ (Mars-like) up to ~60⨁ (felt at inner gas dwarf surfaces). 
	- Spans everything from fragile ultralow-gravity cometary clumps to neutronium-crusted compact objects just short of degeneracy collapse.
	- This definition also accommodates highly stratified gas layers (e.g. floatable biospheres in Saturnian-class or puffy hot-Neptune exotics).
	- Any values beyond this envelope cross into **ulsic** or **hypotheticals**: black holes, quark matter, etc.
- **Radius (⨁):** up to 11⨁ to accommodate inflation-limited gas giants and Super-Jupiters.
	- Frequently exceeded by puffy planemons due to close proximity to their stars inflating their atmospheres.
- **Escape Velocity (⨁):** capped at 25⨁ ≈ 280 km/s, brushing the domain of hot-start brown dwarfs.

> These are **not bound by Earth-normal biology**. They simply represent physically plausible, self-cohering planemon-scale entities where exotic life — as chemistry permits — might arise.
